# Asymptotic utilities: WLLN wrapper and CMT for convergence in measure

This file contains small, reusable lemmas about convergence in probability
(`TendstoInMeasure`) that Hansen's Chapter 7 consistency proof needs but
Mathlib does not currently provide as named lemmas:

* `tendstoInMeasure_continuous_comp` — a **continuous-mapping theorem** for
  `TendstoInMeasure` along `atTop`. If `f n →ₚ g` and `h` is continuous then
  `h ∘ f n →ₚ h ∘ g`. Proved via Mathlib's subsequence characterization
  `exists_seq_tendstoInMeasure_atTop_iff`.
* `tendstoInMeasure_wlln` — a **weak law of large numbers** wrapper: strong
  law gives a.s. convergence, and in a finite-measure space a.s. convergence
  implies convergence in measure.
* `tendstoInMeasure_transformed_wlln` — Hansen Theorem 6.2 as a transformed
  WLLN wrapper over `tendstoInMeasure_wlln`.
* `tendstoInDistribution_continuous_comp` — Hansen Theorem 6.7 in the global
  continuous-map case, wrapping Mathlib's distributional CMT.

Both are stated for general Banach-space codomains, so they specialize
directly to scalar, vector, and matrix random variables.

/-- **Continuous mapping theorem for convergence in probability** along `atTop`.

If a sequence `f : ℕ → α → E` of strongly measurable functions converges in
measure to `g : α → E`, and `h : E → F` is continuous, then
`fun n ω => h (f n ω)` converges in measure to `fun ω => h (g ω)`.

Proof strategy: Mathlib's `exists_seq_tendstoInMeasure_atTop_iff` says
`TendstoInMeasure ... atTop ...` is equivalent to "every subsequence has a
further subsequence that converges almost surely." Continuity lifts almost-sure
convergence directly; the iff then lifts the whole statement back to
convergence in measure. -/

/-- **Local continuous mapping theorem for convergence in probability to a constant.**

If `f n →ₚ x` and `h` is continuous at `x`, then `h (f n) →ₚ h x`, provided
the composed sequence is a.e. strongly measurable. The explicit measurability
premise is necessary because continuity at one point does not imply global
measurability of `h`. -/

textbook's a.s.-continuity variant is stronger and can be added separately if a
downstream proof needs it. -/

If `Xₙ ⇒ Z`, then every nonnegative bounded continuous test function has
limit-law expectation bounded by the liminf of the sequence expectations. This
is the weak-convergence-facing core behind Hansen Theorems 6.13 and 6.15; the
unbounded norm and uniform-integrability wrappers build on this Portmanteau

If `X : ℕ → Ω → E` is a sequence of pairwise-independent, identically distributed,
integrable `E`-valued random variables on a finite-measure space, then the sample
mean `(1/n) ∑_{i<n} X i` converges in probability to `𝔼[X 0]`.

This is the direct composition of Mathlib's `strong_law_ae` with

/-- **Hansen Theorem 6.2, transformed WLLN.**

If `X i` are pairwise-independent and identically distributed and `h (X 0)` is integrable,
then the sample mean of the transformed variables `h (X i)` converges in probability to
`𝔼[h (X 0)]`. This is the textbook transformed WLLN packaged as composition of the
Banach-valued WLLN with measurable-map preservation of independence and identical distribution. -/

# Chapter 2 Potential Outcomes

This file starts the variable-facing potential-outcomes API for Hansen Section 2.30.
The first public surface is stated as random-variable and almost-everywhere identities, matching the
Chapter 2 probability layer. Pointwise regular-conditional-distribution versions of Theorem 2.12 can
be built on top of this layer later.
